            CezarX is a collateral lending protocol that enables collectors to take out a fixed-rate loan using their NFT as collateral. The loan is funded by liquidity providers who earn interest paid by the borrower. In the event of a default on the loan ownership of the NFT is fractionalized and transferred to the liquidity providers. An exclusive auction is held where only the liquidity providers are eligible to bid.
          </p>

            <h4>How much can I borrow against my NFT?</h4>
            <p>
              A loan can be taken out for up to 50% of the CezarX appraisal value. A fixed-rate of 10% interest is charged for the term loan.

              Our smart contracts are trustless and automated. They take possession of your collateral if the loan is not paid by the agreed upon date and time.
